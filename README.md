# Fives

A card game involving making sets of cards in order to get rid of all the cards in your hand.

## How to Play

The game consists of 6 rounds. Each round has a specific set size in order for you to lay down, these are:

1. One set of three cards
2. Two sets of three cards
3. One set of four cards
4. Two sets of four cards
5. One set of five cards
6. Two sets of five cards

In the first pass around the table, you can't lay down any sets. On your go, you must choose to take either one card from the deck or a card from the discard pile. Your go ends when you discard a card. After the first pass, you can only start laying if you have the prescribed set for the roung. From the go after you've layed the prescribed set for the round, you can add cards to the sets that have been layed, either yours or another players.

Black twos can be used as any card.

## Scoring

The round ends when one of the players has got rid of all of their cards. The players with cards remaining must count add the values of all the cards in their hands to get their score. Face cards are worth 10, and Aces (that can be used as high or low cards) are worth 15, all other cards are the value displayed on the card. There is a gotcha where, if you have a black two in your hand, the value of your hand is doubled. For each black two in your hand, the value doubles!!

The winner is the person with the lowest score.

# TODO

1. Should only be able to discard if you have 1 card left
2. Handle what happens when the game is finished. - Setting the title, not dealing anymore cards, still showing the score
